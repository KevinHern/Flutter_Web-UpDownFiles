# ABOUT ME
This repository contains code of how to upload or download files from a self made backend server using Flutter as UI.

The backend server was made using Python 3.7 and Flask as the framework to handle all the incoming requests and server shenanigans. Flutter acts as the intermediary between the user and the server to extract or upload files to said entity.

# Details
The backend server can handle CORS requests and has enough configurations to get deployed to a heroku server.

For the Python Server script, you can find it in the directory 'python_server' along with some dummy files. The rest are directories generated by the Flutter project
